    // It's a bloom filter! When 'hmm, probably' is a good substitute for 'definitely'
    // ...which in a real-world smart contract seems unlikely. But hey, this is code golf!
    
    // In all seriousness, a bloom filter would serve as a good 'first pass' to validate
    // set membership: if a 100% set membership test is expensive the bloom filter will
    // limit the number of instances where the expensive test is required.
    // A real-world example of this would be if the data to be iterated over is in storage, not
    // memory, where sload costs 200 gas. A small bloom filter could be used which would be much cheaper to recall

    // NB. My previous evm-optimized entry had a 'minor' bug where I forgot to label
    // the uniquify function as 'external'. As a result the calldata was being dumped into
    // memory at the indices of my bloom filter, filling it up with junk.
    // I thought it was odd that I needed a filter length about 10x larger than I calculated for...

    // probability of a hash collision = (1-e^(-kn/m))^k
    // k = number of hash functions
    // n = number of elements in set
    // m = bit-length of bloom filter
    // assuming n tops out at around 256 (although...)
    // then m = 32*256 bits and k=4 gives probability p of 0.002%
    // the value of k seems to be the overriding gas guzzler despite my best efforts
    // setting k=1 and having a larger bitfield (0x80 machine words: 4096 bytes, 2^21 bits)
    // seems to be the most gas-efficient way of getting an acceptably low p-value

            // duplicating a stack-based pointer which costs 3 gas.
            // Reducing the stack depth also removes the need for 1 swap op (3 gas),

            // and the calldata pointer, which requires a swap
            // Total gas saving: 10 gas per iteration

            // in order to do this, we store data in a word that is one word after the
            // reserved bloom filter memory.
            // We use the memory from 0x100 to 0x1100 to store our bloom filter,
            // which is 128 machine words. Some testing showed we only need 85 words,
            // but having a value that is a power of 2 allows for very cheap indexing in our
            // main loop, which is worth the extra gas costs of a larger filter
            0x01 0x1100 mstore

    // ### MAIN LOOP
    // We know there's at least one array element, so fall into the loop
        loop_start:
            // Load current array index
            dup1 calldataload           // stack state: v
            // In order to convert v into a bloom filter key, we need to 'hash' v
            // and create a deterministic pseudo-random number.
            // Multiplying v by a large prime does the trick. Not very 'random' but it adds
            // enough entropy for the filter to work. We use the field-modulus of the
            // 254 bit Barreto Naehrig curve 'bn128' as it's big, it's prime and I happen to have it
            // lying around my project files
            0x30644e72e131a029b85045b68181585d97816a916871ca8d3c208c16d87cfd47 mul // stack state: h s

            // N.B. we consume 'v' with the above op. If we need to add 'v' to the set, we
            // need to pull it out of calldata again. If the probability of adding an
            // element to a set is &lt; 5/8, grabbing it back is cheaper than keeping v
            // around, as we would need to pop it off the stack if we don't add v to the set

            // Get the memory index of the bloom filter limb for this value
            // a logical AND between h and 0xfe0 produces a pseudorandom number
            // from 0 to 4,064 that is divisible by 32
            // i.e. memory indices for 32 byte words from 0 to 128.
            // If the bloom filter range was not a power of 2 we wouldn't be able to
            // use a logical AND to pull out a limb index and would need a more expensive mod opcode.
            // We add 0x100 to the lookup index to account for our lookup table
            dup1 0xfe0 and 0x100 add    // stack state: i h s

            // Now that we have a filter limb, we need a pseudo random 8-bit value to
            // test the filter with. We use the 28th least significant byte of 'h';
            // we use the 30th and 31st to construct our filter index and we want a 
            // low value because our prime is only 254 bits long, so grabbing the most significant
            // byte won't give very pseudorandom values for small integers
            swap1 28 byte mload         // stack state: b i s

            // Test if the bit in 'b' is already set in our filter limb. If the bit is set
            // we assume that this element is already part of the output set and not unique
            // N.B. we need mload(i) again if we add to the set, but it's not kept on the stack
            // for the same reasons as 'v'
            dup2 mload dup2 and skip_add_to_set jumpi

    // ### ADD TO SET
    // Alright! The high bit in 'b' wasn't set in our bloom filter, so this
    // is a unique value that we should add to output array

                // step 1, get 'v' back from calldata and store it at the next free memory index
                dup3 calldataload msize mstore
                // step 2, update the filter limb to include the bit set in 'b'
                dup2 mload or           // stack state: r i s
                // step 3, store the updated limb
                swap1 mstore            // stack state: s
                // step 4, increase calldata pointer
                0x20 add                // stack state: s'

            // 0x00 - 0x20: relative index of start of array (which is 0x20)
            // 0x20 - 0x40: number of array elements
            // 0x40 - rest: array

            0x40 add 0x10e0 return
    // ### SKIP ADD TO SET
            // small subroutine if we don't add element to set in our main loop. Placed below
            // 'return' code because I want the 'add to set' *jumpi* instruction to fall into
            // the return code if the jump condition fails
            skip_add_to_set:
                // 'b' and 'i' are still on the stack, get rid of them so we
                // don't have unbalanced stack issues in our loop
                pop pop
                // increment calldatapointer and perform same test as in main loop
                0x20 add
                calldatasize dup2 lt loop_start jumpi

            // Repeat 'return' code to avoid a jump instruction and save some gas
            0x20 0x10e0 mstore          // stack state:
            0x1120 msize sub            // stack state: l
            0x20 dup2 div 0x1100 mstore // stack state: l
            0x40 add 0x10e0 return

            // the variable number of 'pop' instructions in the main loop upsets the compiler, poor thing
            // pop a stack variable to prevent it from throwing errors
            pop
